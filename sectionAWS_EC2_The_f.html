<h1 data-label="aws-ec2-the-foundation-of-elastic-computing" class="ltx_title_section">AWS EC2: The foundation of elastic
computing</h1><div>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the cornerstone of elastic
computing within AWS, providing scalable, on-demand compute capacity in
the cloud. EC2 allows businesses to dynamically provision virtual
servers, known as instances, to meet their varying computational needs.
This flexibility marked a paradigm shift in the way organizations deploy
and manage compute resources, offering an unprecedented level of control
over processing power, storage, networking, and memory configurations.
At its core, <b>Amazon EC2</b> operates by virtualizing the underlying
hardware, allowing users to run applications without needing to invest
in or maintain physical servers. This section will provide a deeper
understanding of EC2’s architecture, focusing on the key components of
compute, networking, storage, and memory, which are critical for
understanding the full capabilities of EC2.</div><h2 data-label="key-components-of-amazon-ec2-architecture" class="ltx_title_subsection">Key Components of Amazon EC2
Architecture</h2><div>An Amazon EC2 instance functions as a virtual server within the AWS
Cloud. When launching an EC2 instance, the chosen instance type dictates
the hardware configuration available. Each instance type provides a
unique combination of compute power, memory, storage, and networking
capacity, ensuring flexibility and performance for a wide range of
workloads [1].</div>
