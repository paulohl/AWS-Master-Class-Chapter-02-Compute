<h1 data-label="objectives" class="ltx_title_section">Objectives</h1><div>This chapter aims to provide a thorough understanding of various
foundational compute services offered by AWS. It begins with an
exploration of Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and Spot Instances, followed by
container orchestration using Amazon ECS and EKS. The chapter also
discusses benefits and use cases of serverless computing through AWS
Lambda and simplifies application deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
and App Runner. It covers optimizing workloads and resources with AWS
Compute Optimizer and Auto Scaling, as well as extending AWS
capabilities with Local Zones and Outposts. The readers will discover
new technologies such as AWS Wavelength and VMware Cloud on AWS, and
gain insights into batch computing with AWS Batch. Access to simplified
compute solutions like Lightsail and AWS Fargate is also explored, along
with understanding hybrid cloud solutions using AWS SimSpace Weaver.
These objectives collectively offer a comprehensive exploration of AWS
compute services, equipping readers with the knowledge to leverage the
most suitable tools for their specific needs.</div>
