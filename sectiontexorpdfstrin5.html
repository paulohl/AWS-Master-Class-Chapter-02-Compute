is essential for driving operational efficiency and minimizing costs.<b>AWS Compute Optimizer</b> provides a machine learning-powered
solution that analyzes resource usage and offers tailored
recommendations for optimizing computing performance and cost. This
section delves into the capabilities of AWS Compute Optimizer,
highlighting its features, use cases, and real-world applications backed
by research and AWS documentation.</div><h3 data-label="aws-compute-optimizer-a-detailed-overview" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">AWS Compute Optimizer: A Detailed
Overview</h3><div><b>AWS Compute Optimizer</b> is designed to help organizations
optimize the configuration of their Amazon EC2 instances [31], EBS
volumes, Lambda functions, and Auto Scaling groups by analyzing
historical usage data and workload patterns. Using machine learning, the
service assesses performance metrics to provide actionable
recommendations that balance both cost and performance. It identifies
underutilized resources, suggesting resizing or switching to more
cost-effective instance types. Compute Optimizer offers a complete
assessment of the resource fleet, making it easier for businesses to
right-size their infrastructure.
One of the key features of Compute Optimizer is its ability to generate
detailed reports on the potential cost savings organizations can achieve
by applying its recommendations. These insights allow businesses to
evaluate performance trade-offs and make informed decisions on instance
type selections, EBS volume configurations, and scaling policies.
