<div>Figure 1 AWS EC2 architecture components. (AWS Documentation)</div><h3 data-label="compute-1" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Compute</h3><div>EC2 instances provide the virtual CPUs (vCPUs) necessary to handle the
computing needs of your application. When launching an EC2 instance,
users can choose from a variety of instance types that are optimized for
different use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized,
memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and accelerated computing
instances. Each instance type is defined by factors such as:</div><ul><li><b>Number of vCPUs:</b> The compute capacity is measured in virtual
CPUs, which represent the number of processing cores allocated to the
instance.</li><li><b>Hypervisor:</b> EC2 uses the Nitro hypervisor for bare-metal
performance and enhanced security, with minimal overhead.</li><li><b>Instance Lifecycle:</b> Instances can be started, stopped, or
terminated as required, making it easy to adjust resources based on
demand.</li></ul><div>For example, a general-purpose instance like the <b>t3.micro</b> provides a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, making it
ideal for small workloads like microservices. In contrast, a
compute-optimized instance like <b>c6g.large</b> provides greater
processing power and is suited for high-performance computing tasks,
such as batch processing or machine learning model training.</div><h3 data-label="network" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Network</h3><div>Networking is a critical part of EC2’s infrastructure, enabling secure
and efficient communication between instances and external resources.
Key networking components include:</div><ul><li><b>Elastic Network Interface (ENI):</b> An ENI is a logical
networking component that can be attached to an instance to provide
networking capabilities, including an IP address, MAC address, and
security groups.</li><li><b>Elastic IP Addresses:</b> EC2 provides the ability to reserve
static public IP addresses, known as Elastic IPs, which can be
reassigned to any instance in your account, making failover or
instance replacement more seamless.</li><li><b>Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (ACLs):</b> Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances,
controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Network ACLs operate at the
subnet level, providing an additional layer of security.</li><li><b>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):</b> Each EC2 instance runs in a VPC,
which allows for fine-grained control over the networking environment,
including subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.</li></ul><h3 data-label="storage" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Storage</h3><div>Amazon EC2 offers various types of storage to suit different application
needs, from ephemeral instance storage to persistent block storage. The
primary storage solutions available with EC2 include:</div><ul><li><b>Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS):</b> EBS provides block-level
storage that persists independently of the lifecycle of the EC2
instance. EBS volumes can be attached to an instance and used to store
data such as operating systems, applications, and databases. EBS
volumes can be configured for different performance requirements, such
as <b>gp3</b> (General Purpose SSD) for balanced performance or<b>io2</b> (Provisioned IOPS SSD) for high-performance storage.</li><li><b>Instance Store:</b> Instance store provides temporary block-level
storage, which is directly attached to the physical server hosting the
EC2 instance. This storage is ephemeral, meaning that data is lost
when the instance is stopped or terminated. It’s useful for stateless
applications or temporary data processing tasks.</li><li><b>Elastic File System (EFS):</b> EFS is a scalable, shared file
system that can be attached to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.
It is ideal for scenarios where multiple instances need to read and
write to the same file system, such as content management systems or
distributed applications.</li></ul><h3 data-label="memory" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Memory</h3><div>The memory resources of an EC2 instance play a crucial role in
determining its performance, especially for applications that require
large in-memory databases or complex data processing. EC2 offers
memory-optimized instances that provide large amounts of RAM to handle
memory-intensive tasks. These instances, such as <b>r5.large</b> , are
ideal for real-time big data processing or high-performance computing
applications that require rapid access to large datasets.</div><h3 data-label="elasticity-and-scalability" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Elasticity and
Scalability</h3><div>One of the primary strengths of EC2 is its elasticity—the ability to
scale compute resources up or down based on demand. EC2 allows for
vertical scaling (changing instance types) or horizontal scaling (adding
or removing instances) [2]. This is particularly useful for
applications with unpredictable workloads or traffic spikes.</div><div><b>Auto Scaling:</b> EC2 integrates with Auto Scaling groups to
automatically increase or decrease the number of running instances
based on predefined conditions, such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
or network throughput. For example, an e-commerce site may use Auto
Scaling to handle increased traffic during a sale and scale back down
during off-peak hours, reducing costs without compromising
performance.</div><div><b>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):</b> ELB distributes incoming
traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and
fault tolerance. By combining Auto Scaling and ELB, applications can
dynamically adjust to varying loads without manual intervention.</div><h2 data-label="use-cases-for-ec2" class="ltx_title_subsection">Use Cases for EC2</h2><div>Amazon EC2 is versatile and can be applied across a wide range of
industries and use cases, including:</div><ol><li><b>Web Hosting and Applications</b> : EC2 instances can serve as web
servers that host dynamic websites, web applications, or RESTful APIs.
Paired with services like Amazon RDS and S3, it provides a complete
environment for modern web hosting.</li><li><b>Big Data and Analytics</b> : High-performance compute instances
and memory-optimized instances are ideal for big data processing
tasks, such as running Hadoop clusters or analyzing large datasets
with Spark. EC2 allows organizations to process large volumes of data
efficiently and on-demand.</li><li><b>Gaming</b> : Compute-optimized instances, like the <b>c6g</b> family, support game hosting and real-time multiplayer games by
providing low-latency networking and compute power to handle large
player loads.</li><li><b>High-Performance Computing (HPC)</b> [3]: EC2’s
compute-optimized and accelerated instances enable complex scientific
simulations, molecular modeling, and machine learning model training
by providing powerful GPU support and high IOPS storage.</li><li><b>Disaster Recovery</b> : EC2’s ability to launch instances in
different regions ensures high availability in disaster recovery
scenarios. Organizations can failover workloads to another region in
the event of a disruption, ensuring minimal downtime and continuity of
operations.</li></ol><h2 data-label="wrapping-up" class="ltx_title_subsection">Wrapping up</h2><div>Amazon EC2 is the foundation of elastic computing in AWS, providing an
expansive array of compute, networking, storage, and memory options that
empower organizations to deploy and scale applications with ease. Its
flexibility in instance configuration, combined with its integrated
services for scaling and managing workloads [4], allows EC2 to meet
the diverse needs of developers, enterprises, and startups alike. As we
continue exploring EC2 in the following sections, we will uncover its
advanced features and how it can be harnessed to build scalable,
resilient, and cost-effective applications in the cloud.</div>
