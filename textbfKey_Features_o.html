<div><b>Key Features of VMware Cloud on AWS:</b></div><ul><li><b>Seamless Integration</b> : VMware workloads can run natively on
AWS without changes, providing a <b>consistent operational
experience</b> across both environments. Tools such as <b>vCenter</b> ,<b>vSAN</b> , and <b>NSX</b> are supported, ensuring that
organizations can manage their cloud resources with familiar VMware
tools.</li><li><b>Scalability and Flexibility</b> : VMware Cloud on AWS leverages<b>automated cluster scaling</b> , enabling users to scale up or down
as needed. Organizations can also access native AWS services such as<b>Amazon S3</b> for storage, <b>Amazon RDS</b> for databases, and<b>AWS Lambda</b> for serverless computing.</li><li><b>Disaster Recovery</b> : With <b>robust disaster recovery</b> capabilities, VMware Cloud on AWS offers <b>automated failover</b> and backup for mission-critical workloads, ensuring high availability
in the event of hardware or network failures.</li><li><b>Hybrid Cloud Adoption</b> : Organizations can transition to a<b>hybrid cloud architecture</b> without disrupting existing
operations. This allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of both
on-premises and cloud resources, while maintaining <b>data
residency</b> , <b>security</b> , and <b>compliance</b> .</li></ul><div>VMware Cloud on AWS provides a unified approach to <b>migrating</b> ,<b>scaling</b> , and <b>managing</b> VMware workloads. The service
extends the familiar <b>VMware SDDC</b> stack into the cloud, allowing
organizations to leverage AWS’s global reach and infrastructure while
maintaining <b>full compatibility</b> with their existing on-premises
VMware environments [52].</div><h3 data-label="exploring-use-cases-and-efficiency-amplification" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Exploring Use Cases and Efficiency
Amplification</h3><div>The research landscape around <b>hybrid cloud architectures</b> consistently highlights the importance of flexibility, scalability, and
the seamless integration of <b>on-premises</b> and <b>cloud
resources</b> [53]. VMware Cloud on AWS offers organizations the
ability to efficiently <b>extend their data centers</b> into the
cloud, without incurring the time and costs associated with refactoring
their VMware applications.</div><div><b>Key Use Cases for VMware Cloud on AWS</b> [52]<b>:</b></div><ol><li><b>Data Center Extension</b> : Organizations can extend their<b>on-premises VMware environments</b> to AWS, using the cloud to
handle <b>capacity expansion</b> during peak periods or as a<b>disaster recovery site</b> . This eliminates the need for
over-provisioning on-premises resources, reducing costs while
maintaining performance and availability.</li><li><b>Disaster Recovery</b> : By leveraging VMware Cloud on AWS,
businesses can implement <b>disaster recovery</b> solutions that
ensure minimal downtime in the event of a failure. Data can be backed
up and <b>automatically restored</b> in AWS, safeguarding critical
systems and data.</li><li><b>Cloud Migration</b> : Companies seeking to migrate their VMware
workloads to AWS can use VMware Cloud on AWS for<b>lift-and-shift migrations</b> . This allows them to move their
applications and data without refactoring, significantly reducing
migration complexity and timelines.</li><li><b>Hybrid Cloud</b> : For businesses that need to <b>keep
certain workloads on-premises</b> while moving others to the cloud,
VMware Cloud on AWS provides a flexible hybrid cloud environment. This
is particularly useful in industries with <b>strict data
residency requirements</b> or where <b>latency-sensitive
applications</b> need to remain close to users.</li></ol><h3 data-label="real-world-applications-of-vmware-cloud-on-aws" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Real-World Applications of VMware Cloud on
