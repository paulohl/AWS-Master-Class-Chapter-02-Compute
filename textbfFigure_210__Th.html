Overview</h2><div><b>AWS Batch</b> is a fully managed service that simplifies the
execution of batch processing jobs by abstracting the underlying compute
resources. This service allows users to focus on defining their
workloads rather than managing infrastructure. It supports both
containerized and non-containerized applications, providing flexibility
for running a wide variety of batch jobs. AWS Batch enables users to
configure <b>job queues</b> , <b>job definitions</b> , and<b>compute environments</b> , tailoring the batch processes to specific
needs.</div><div>AWS Batch integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like<b>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)</b> and <b>Amazon
Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</b> , making containerized batch processing
more efficient. This integration allows users to take advantage of AWS’s
container management capabilities, leveraging the scalability of
containers to run a diverse set of workloads, from data transformation
and image processing to scientific analysis and large-scale simulations.</div><div>Refer to the following figure:</div>
