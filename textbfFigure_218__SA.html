Amplification</h3><div>Though scholarly articles [40] may not focus exclusively on AWS
Lambda, research into <b>serverless computing</b> highlights its
profound impact on simplifying application development and management.<b>Serverless architectures</b> reduce operational overhead, optimize
resource allocation, and enhance scalability, transforming how
organizations approach cloud-native development. AWS Lambda’s features
align perfectly with these principles, allowing organizations to
optimize their infrastructure and deliver robust, scalable applications
without the complexity of traditional server management.</div><div><b>AWS Lambda</b> is applicable across a broad spectrum of use cases,
and its documentation underscores its versatility in multiple scenarios.
Some key use cases include:</div><ol><li><b>Web Applications</b> : Lambda can serve as the backend for web
applications, enabling developers to build APIs, handle user requests,
and respond to HTTP events via <b>Amazon API Gateway</b> . By
leveraging Lambda, applications can scale automatically to meet demand
without manual intervention.</li><li><b>Real-Time Data Processing</b> : Lambda’s event-driven model makes
it ideal for real-time data analytics and processing. Whether
processing streams of data from <b>Amazon Kinesis</b> or handling
object events in <b>Amazon S3</b> , Lambda efficiently processes
incoming data as it arrives, enabling rapid response times and
real-time insights.</li><li><b>IoT Applications</b> : Lambda integrates seamlessly with<b>AWS IoT</b> , triggering functions in response to sensor data from
IoT devices. This is particularly useful for applications such as<b>anomaly detection</b> , where Lambda processes incoming data and
automatically triggers alerts or responses when irregular patterns are
identified.</li><li><b>Microservices Architectures</b> : Lambda is a powerful tool for
running microservices, allowing each service to scale independently in
response to user requests or system events. This decoupled
architecture ensures fault tolerance and modular scalability.</li><li><b>Automated Workflows</b> : Lambda can also be used to automate
routine tasks, such as <b>data backups</b> , <b>file
transformations</b> , or even responding to system alerts. By integrating
Lambda with <b>Amazon CloudWatch</b> or <b>AWS Config</b> ,
organizations can automatically execute workflows triggered by
predefined thresholds or configurations [39].</li></ol><div>Refer to the following figure:</div>
