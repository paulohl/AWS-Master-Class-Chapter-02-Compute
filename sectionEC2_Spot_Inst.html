<h1 data-label="ec2-spot-instances-cost-efficient-computing" class="ltx_title_section">EC2 Spot Instances: cost-efficient
computing</h1><div>In the ever-evolving realm of cloud computing, organizations continually
seek ways to optimize infrastructure costs while maintaining
high-performance computing capabilities. Amazon EC2 Spot Instances
presents a cost-effective solution by providing access to spare EC2
capacity at significantly reduced rates compared to On-Demand instances.
In this section, we will explore Amazon EC2 Spot Instances in greater
depth, examining their features, cost benefits, and practical
applications in real-world scenarios.
Amazon EC2 Spot Instances allow organizations to take advantage of
unused EC2 capacity, offering up to 90% savings over On-Demand pricing.
These instances are particularly suited to workloads that are flexible
in terms of when they run and can tolerate potential interruptions. Spot
Instances are launched when spare capacity becomes available and
terminated when AWS reclaims that capacity for other customers. The
pricing for Spot Instances is driven by supply and demand, making them
ideal for organizations looking to maximize cost-efficiency during
periods of excess capacity.
Spot Instances can be integrated into a wide array of instance types and
configurations [7], allowing users to select the best fit for their
specific workloads. They are especially useful for applications that can
distribute tasks across multiple instances, such as batch processing,
big data analytics, containerized applications, and high-performance
computing [7] tasks like genomic research and machine learning.
The illustration below showcases IPONWEB’s use of EC2 Spot Instances and
On-Demand Instances to efficiently manage their real-time bidding
workloads. Spot Instances, which offer cost savings by utilizing spare
capacity, are employed to handle the compute tasks in the same
availability zone (AZ) as their database, ensuring low-latency and
minimizing cross-AZ traffic costs. However, when Spot Instances are
unavailable, the system automatically shifts to On-Demand Instances to
maintain operational stability. This approach optimizes both performance
and cost, leveraging the flexibility of Spot Instances while relying on
On-Demand Instances for reliability during peak demands [8]:</div>
