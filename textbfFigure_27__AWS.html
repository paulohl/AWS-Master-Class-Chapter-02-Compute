Efficiency</h3><div>While AWS App Runner may be relatively new to the cloud ecosystem, its
approach aligns with broader industry trends that emphasize the need for
simplifying application deployment processes. In the modern development
environment, where time-to-market is crucial [24], organizations are
constantly looking for ways to reduce the operational burden on their
developers. Research in application deployment automation, such as<i>Efficient Application Deployment in the Cloud</i> by White et al.
(2020) [25], highlights the growing importance of services that
automate infrastructure management.</div>
